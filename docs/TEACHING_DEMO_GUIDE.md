# üéì Teaching Demo Guide for AgenticMeet AI

## Overview
This guide helps you demonstrate AgenticMeet AI to students and explain how each component works.

---

## üìã Before the Demo

### Prerequisites
1. Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install FFmpeg: `choco install ffmpeg` (Windows)
3. Download NLTK data: `python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"`
4. Prepare a sample meeting audio file (3-5 minutes long)

### Suggested Sample Audio
- Record a short mock meeting with 2-3 people
- Discuss a simple project with:
  - A deadline ("We need this done by Friday")
  - A budget concern ("This might be expensive")
  - Action items ("John will research the options")
  - A decision ("We decided to go with Option A")

---

## üé¨ Demo Flow (30-45 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)
**What to say:**
> "Today we'll explore a real AI application that uses multiple AI models working together. This app can listen to a meeting recording and automatically:
> - Write down everything said (transcription)
> - Figure out who said what (speaker diarization)
> - Create a summary with action items
> - Detect risks and deadlines
> - Translate to other languages"

**Show them:** [README.md](../README.md) with the feature list

---

### Part 2: Run the Application (5 minutes)

**Terminal Demo:**
```bash
cd AgenticMeet-AI
streamlit run python_code/_app.py
```

**What to explain:**
- Streamlit creates a web interface from Python code
- The app runs locally on your computer
- Opens in browser at `http://localhost:8501`

---

### Part 3: Upload and Process (10 minutes)

**Steps:**
1. Upload your sample audio file
2. **Pause here and explain what's happening:**

**Explain each processing step as it runs:**

#### Step 1: Transcription (Whisper AI)
> "The app is using OpenAI's Whisper model - a neural network trained on 680,000 hours of audio. It converts sound waves into text by:
> 1. Converting audio to spectrogram (visual representation)
> 2. Processing through transformer layers
> 3. Predicting the most likely words"

**Show them:** [python_code/_transcribe.py:10-20](../python_code/_transcribe.py) (the Whisper loading code)

#### Step 2: Speaker Detection (PyAnnote)
> "Now it's figuring out who spoke when using PyAnnote Audio. This AI creates a unique 'voiceprint' for each speaker and clusters similar voices together."

**Show them:** [python_code/_speaker_manager.py](../python_code/_speaker_manager.py)

#### Step 3: Text Cleaning (NLTK + spaCy)
> "The text is cleaned using Natural Language Processing - removing filler words, fixing grammar, etc."

**Show them:** [python_code/_text_cleaner.py](../python_code/_text_cleaner.py)

---

### Part 4: Explore Features (15 minutes)

Navigate through each tab and explain:

#### Tab 1: Speakers
**Show:**
- Speaker timeline visualization
- Ability to rename speakers

**Explain:**
> "The timeline shows when each person spoke. The AI doesn't know their real names, so we can assign them. This uses speaker embeddings - numerical representations of voice characteristics."

**Concepts to teach:**
- Voice embeddings (vectors representing voice features)
- Clustering algorithms grouping similar voices
- Data visualization with Plotly

#### Tab 2: Translation
**Show:**
- Translate to Spanish/French/German
- Side-by-side comparison

**Explain:**
> "This uses Google's Neural Machine Translation. It's an encoder-decoder model that:
> 1. Encodes the meaning of the English text
> 2. Decodes it into the target language
> Unlike old word-by-word translation, it understands context!"

**Concepts to teach:**
- Sequence-to-sequence models
- Encoder-decoder architecture
- Attention mechanism

#### Tab 3: Transcript with Risk Highlights
**Show:**
- Color-coded risk items
- Search functionality

**Explain:**
> "The app uses pattern matching and keywords to detect:
> - Deadlines (red)
> - Budget concerns (yellow)
> - Legal issues (blue)
> - Customer problems (red)
>
> This combines AI with rule-based logic - sometimes simple rules work best!"

**Concepts to teach:**
- Regular expressions (regex)
- Pattern matching
- Hybrid AI (ML + rules)

#### Tab 4: Risk Analysis
**Show:**
- Risk distribution pie chart
- Priority recommendations

**Explain:**
> "Data visualization helps us understand complex information. The AI categorizes risks by priority using both pattern matching and context analysis."

#### Tab 5: Analytics
**Show:**
- Speaker contribution charts
- Word cloud
- Meeting statistics

**Explain:**
> "This uses several techniques:
> - TF-IDF to find important keywords (measures word importance)
> - Statistical analysis for metrics
> - NLP to extract entities (people, places, organizations)"

**Concepts to teach:**
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Data aggregation and statistics

#### Tab 6: Topics
**Show:**
- Automatic topic segmentation
- Topic summaries

**Explain:**
> "The app uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to group similar parts of the conversation:
> 1. Converts text to numerical vectors (TF-IDF)
> 2. Calculates similarity between segments
> 3. Groups similar segments into topics
> 4. Uses Hugging Face transformers to summarize each topic"

**Concepts to teach:**
- Text vectorization
- Cosine similarity
- K-means clustering
- Abstractive summarization

#### Tab 7: Summary
**Show:**
- Executive summary
- Action items
- Key decisions
- Next meeting agenda

**Explain:**
> "This uses a pre-trained BART or T5 model from Hugging Face:
> - Trained on millions of documents
> - Fine-tuned for summarization
> - Uses transfer learning (starting with knowledge from other tasks)
>
> The next meeting agenda uses the summary + risks to suggest what to discuss next."

**Concepts to teach:**
- Transfer learning
- Pre-trained models
- Fine-tuning
- Abstractive vs extractive summarization

#### Tab 8: Export
**Show:**
- PDF export options
- Different report types

**Explain:**
> "All the AI analysis can be exported to PDF for sharing. This uses ReportLab to generate formatted documents."

result = model.transcribe(audio_file)
```

#### 3. NLP Processing
**File:** [python_code/_summarize.py](../python_code/_summarize.py)

A: Free! All models are open-source. (Except translation API has limits)

**Q: "Can it transcribe any language?"**
A: Whisper supports 97 languages, but accuracy varies.

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**
A: Whisper is ~95% accurate for clear English audio. Speaker diarization is ~85-90% accurate.

**Q: "Could we use this for live meetings?"**
A: Not currently - it's designed for recorded files. But possible to extend!

**Q: "What if there's background noise?"**
A: Whisper handles some noise well, but very noisy audio will reduce accuracy.

**Q: "Can it detect sarcasm or emotions?"**
A: Not yet - that would require additional sentiment analysis models.
