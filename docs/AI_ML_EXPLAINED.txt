in AgenticMeet AI. Perfect for teaching students about real-world AI applications.


================================================================================
MAIN AI/ML COMPONENTS
================================================================================

1. OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
-----------------------------------
What it does:
  Converts audio/video recordings into text transcripts

How it works:
  - Uses a transformer-based neural network trained on 680,000 hours of
    multilingual audio
  - Processes audio in chunks and predicts the most likely text
  - Can handle multiple languages, accents, and background noise

Where it's used:
  python_code/_transcribe.py

  Example code:
    import whisper
    model = whisper.load_model("base")  # Model sizes: tiny, small, base, medium, large
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

Key Concepts:
  - Transformer Architecture: Self-attention mechanism that processes sequences
  - Encoder-Decoder Model: Encoder processes audio, decoder generates text
  - Multi-task Training: Trained on transcription, translation, and language
    identification


2. PyAnnote Audio (Speaker Diarization)
----------------------------------------
What it does:
  Identifies "who spoke when" in audio recordings

How it works:
  - Uses deep learning to create speaker embeddings (unique voice fingerprints)
  - Clusters similar embeddings to identify the same speaker
  - Assigns timestamps to each speaker segment

Where it's used:
  python_code/_transcribe.py, python_code/_speaker_manager.py

  Example code:
    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization")
    diarization = pipeline(audio_file)

Key Concepts:
  - Speaker Embeddings: Vector representations of voice characteristics
  - Clustering: Grouping similar voice patterns together
  - Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Detecting when speech is present


3. Hugging Face Transformers (Summarization & NLP)
---------------------------------------------------
What it does:
  Generates summaries, extracts key information, and performs NLP tasks

How it works:
  - Uses pre-trained transformer models like BART or T5
  - Fine-tuned on summarization tasks
  - Can extract action items, decisions, and key points

Where it's used:
  python_code/_summarize.py

  Example code:
    from transformers import pipeline
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=150)

Key Concepts:
  - Attention Mechanism: Focuses on important parts of the text
  - Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Encodes meaning, generates concise output
  - Transfer Learning: Pre-trained on large datasets, fine-tuned for specific tasks


4. spaCy (Natural Language Processing)
---------------------------------------
What it does:
  Performs advanced text analysis, entity recognition, and text processing

How it works:
  - Uses statistical models trained on millions of documents
  - Identifies entities (people, organizations, dates)
  - Performs part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing

Where it's used:
  python_code/_analytics.py, python_code/_text_cleaner.py

  Example code:
    import spacy
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]

Key Concepts:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
  - Dependency Parsing: Understanding grammatical relationships


5. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

  - Statistical and rule-based approaches
  - Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
  - Stop word removal and keyword extraction

Where it's used:
  python_code/_text_cleaner.py, python_code/_analytics.py

  Example code:
    import nltk
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]

Key Concepts:
  - Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences
  - Stop Words: Common words (the, is, at) that don't add meaning
  - TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for keyword extraction


6. Google Translate API / Deep Translator
------------------------------------------

    translated_text = translator.translate(text)

Key Concepts:
  - Neural Machine Translation: Deep learning approach to translation
  - Sequence-to-Sequence Models: Maps input sequence to output sequence
  - Attention Mechanism: Aligns source and target words


7. Scikit-learn (Topic Segmentation & Clustering)
--------------------------------------------------
What it does:
  Segments meetings into topics using unsupervised learning

How it works:
  - Uses TF-IDF to convert text to numerical vectors
  - Applies clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar content
  - Identifies topic changes based on vector similarity

Where it's used:
  python_code/_topic_segmentation.py

  Example code:
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(text_chunks)
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
    clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(vectors)

Key Concepts:
  - TF-IDF Vectorization: Converting text to numerical features
  - Cosine Similarity: Measuring similarity between text vectors
  - K-Means Clustering: Grouping similar items together


8. Regular Expressions & Pattern Matching (Risk Detection)
-----------------------------------------------------------
What it does:
  Detects deadlines, budget concerns, legal issues, and customer problems

How it works:
  - Pattern matching using regex
  - Rule-based keyword detection
  - Context-aware flagging

Where it's used:
  python_code/_flagging.py

  Example code:
    import re

    # Detect deadlines
    deadline_patterns = [
        r'deadline.*\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}',
        r'due by.*\d{1,2}\s+\w+',
        r'must be completed by'
    ]

    for pattern in deadline_patterns:
        matches = re.findall(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)

Key Concepts:
  - Regular Expressions: Pattern matching language
  - Rule-Based Systems: Logic-based decision making
  - Context Windows: Analyzing surrounding text for context
